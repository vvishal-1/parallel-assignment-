This project comprises three CUDA programming exercises:

Sum of First n Integers:

Iterative Approach: Calculates the sum of the first n integers using a loop.

Formula-Based Approach: Calculates the sum using the direct formula.

Vector Addition:

Implements vector addition using statically defined global variables.

Records kernel execution time.

Calculates theoretical and measured memory bandwidth.

Prerequisites NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support.

CUDA Toolkit installed.

C++ compiler compatible with CUDA.

Compilation Use the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (nvcc) to compile the program:

bash Copy Edit nvcc -O3 -o cuda_exercises cuda_exercises.cu Execution Run the compiled executable:

bash Copy Edit ./cuda_exercises Exercises

Sum of First n Integers a. Iterative Approach Description: Calculates the sum by iterating from 1 to n.
Implementation: Each thread computes the sum independently.

b. Formula-Based Approach Description: Uses the formula sum = n * (n + 1) / 2.

Implementation: Each thread applies the formula directly.

Vector Addition Description: Adds two vectors of size N element-wise.
Implementation:

Uses statically defined global device arrays.

Launches a kernel where each thread computes one element of the result vector.

Measures kernel execution time using CUDA events.

Calculates:

Theoretical Memory Bandwidth: Based on device properties.

Measured Memory Bandwidth: Based on actual data transfer and execution time.

Sample Output yaml Copy Edit Vector addition successful. Kernel execution time: 0.123456 ms Theoretical Memory Bandwidth: 320.00 GB/s Measured Memory Bandwidth: 150.00 GB/s Note: Actual output will vary based on hardware and system load.

Profiling To profile the application using nvprof:

bash Copy Edit nvprof ./cuda_exercises
