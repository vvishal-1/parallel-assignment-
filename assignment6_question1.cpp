 Part 1: Square Root vs. Addition and Multiplication â€” Concept
This is a conceptual explanation (no code here, just context):

Square root (sqrtf) is a more complex and time-consuming operation than addition (+) or multiplication (*).

On a GPU, operations like addition/multiplication are faster due to their simple binary nature.

sqrtf(x) often requires hardware approximation and iteration, which takes more clock cycles.
