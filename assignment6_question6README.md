ðŸ“Œ Part 1: Conceptual Understanding
ðŸ§  Description
Square root is a more expensive operation compared to vector addition or multiplication.
While addition and multiplication are simple and fast due to binary nature, sqrtf() involves more complex hardware-level instructions or iterative approximations.
Understanding this is crucial for GPU performance tuning in high-performance computing tasks.
